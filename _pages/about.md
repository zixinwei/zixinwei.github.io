I'm a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)**. My research lies at the intersection of **information retrieval**, **data management**, and **LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, with a focus on **dataset discovery and search for data-centric AI**.

Broadly, I am interested in:

- Task-oriented dataset discovery
- Semantic and knowledge-graph-based methods for dataset discovery
- LLM-powered retrieval
- Search interfaces and tools that support data-centric AI workflows

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chenhao Ma](https://chenhao-ma.github.io/) at CUHK-Shenzhen.

My recent work includes **SemExplorer**, a semantic search interface that helps researchers find datasets using free-form natural language queries together with structural constraints (accepted as a demo at ACM SIGMOD 2025). I am currently working on an end-to-end system that recommend relevant datasets for new research tasks.

Beyond research, I enjoy teaching and mentoring. I have served as a teaching assistant for courses such as Database Systems, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Probability & Statistics, and Intro to CS & Java, and received a TA/USTF Award for my teaching contributions.

You can find my **CV**, **publications**, and **teaching** in the navigation bar above.
