Dataset search on today's portals is still dominated by keyword matching and ad-hoc browsing, which often misses relevant resources and makes iterative sense-making tedious. We present SemExplorer, a demonstration system that supports semantic and customizable dataset search. Users begin with natural-language queries and then refine results through lightweight controls for attributes such as  temporal coverage and format. Under the hood, SemExplorer encodes textual metadata into embeddings for approximate nearest-neighbor retrieval, and optionally re-ranks candidates with user-selected constraints to surface datasets that better match task requirements. The interface is designed for rapid, in-the-loop iteration: previews show key fields and quick statistics; users can pin, compare, and export selections for downstream analysis. The demo walks through several realistic scenarios to highlight how semantic search plus targeted filtering helps users move from vague information needs to actionable datasets. We aim to spur discussion on evaluation protocols for dataset search and on integrating LLM-assisted guidance while preserving transparency and user control.
